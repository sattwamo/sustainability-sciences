      <h2 style="color: #2e7d32">Why Sustainability Science?</h2>
      <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: 1rem auto">
        Sustainability Science is an emerging discipline that examines the
        dynamic interplay between nature and society, exploring how science,
        technology and social transformations influence the environment and vice
        versa. Its goal is to advance science and technology to drive a just and
        equitable transition toward meeting the UN Sustainable Development
        Goals. The 2 year MS Programme in Sustainability Science offered by
        IISER Kolkata equips science and engineering graduates with advanced
        scientific and technical knowledge to become professional leaders in
        addressing sustainability problems in industry and society. The
        programme will impart knowledge, tools and skills to pursue careers in
        academia, industry, non-governmental organization and government and
        become change-agents to drive the goals of a more sustainable planet.

      <h2>Programme Structure</h2>
      <h3>Curriculum</h3>
      <p>
        The curriculum will consist of of a judicial balance of relevant
        foundational sciences, data-science driven decision-making, and
        practical tools to assess, understand, mitigate, and solve challenges
        related to sustainable development. The curriculum will also consist of
        laboratory practice and project work. The course will be taught by an
        interdisciplinary group of faculties drawn from disciplines of
        chemistry, physics, biological sciences, environmental sciences, earth
        and geosciences and data sciences. Students will also have opportunity
        to learn from renowned guest faculties in areas such as engineering and
        technology, economics, social sciences and policy makers to ensure a
        360° view of the complex problem of sustainability
      </p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        The 2 years Master's programme is designed to equip students for a
        career in industry, non-governmental organization or the Government,
        pursuing environmental, sustainability and governance roles, promoting
        sustainable practices in society, and activities related to public
        policy in the Government organizations. Students desirous of continuing
        their education can also pursue further studies/research in the area of
        Sustainability Science.
